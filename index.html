            <p>Patricia Swarin is a freelance front-end developer and designer. After graduating in 2003 with a B.S. in Design
                from Troy University, she joined the team at Square Root Interactive, a web agency focused on enterprise-level
                content management systems as well as creative digital solutions, from branding to marketing. Patricia learned front-end development at the company, in the glory days of slice and dice, beat-your-head-on-the-wall
                IE5/Netscape hell. </p>
            <p>SRI was a small agency that required one to wear multiple hats, and she became a proponent for web standards
                in the office and labeled a CSS guru by her peers. Her day-to-day responsibilities included client meetings,
                creative discoveries, wireframing/prototyping, design, style guides, front-end development and code reviews.
                It was a collaborative environment where front-end and back-end developers worked side by side through project
                completion.
            </p>
            <p>She is also focused on professional development and networking. She has served on the board for the American Advertising Federation - Montgomery chapter as communications chair.</p>
            <p>As a contractor, she continued freelancing with the agency and eventually Ameex Technologies, a company that
                absorbed SRI into their fold, in addition to other freelance projects. She has worked with front-end frameworks
                like Bootstrap. She also has extensive knowledge of Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla.</p>
